These foods provide essential vitamins, minerals, and calories for healthy weight gain. <br><br> <li><strong>Increase calorie intake:</strong> Aim to consume slightly more calories than you burn each day to promote gradual weight gain. Consider adding calorie-dense snacks between meals, such as smoothies with whole milk and fruit, nut butter sandwiches on whole-wheat bread, or trail mix. <br><br> <li><strong>Eat regular meals and snacks:</strong> Don\'t skip meals. Aim for three meals and two to three healthy snacks throughout the day to maintain consistent calorie intake. <br><br> <li><strong>Consider meal replacements:</strong> If you struggle to eat enough throughout the day, consult a healthcare professional about high-calorie, nutrient-rich meal replacements. <br><br><br> For someone who is underweight and looking to gain healthy weight, it\'s important to focus on nutrient-dense foods that provide a good balance of carbohydrates, proteins, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. Here are three food recommendations <br><br> <li> <strong>Nut and Seed Butters</strong>: <img src="bmi calculator/img/nuts.jpg" width="1" height="400"> Include almond butter, peanut butter, or sunflower seed butter in your diet. These spreads are rich in healthy fats, proteins, and calories. Spread them on whole-grain toast, add them to smoothies, or use them as dips for fruits or vegetables.</li> <br> <li> <strong>Avocado</strong>: <img src="bmi calculator/img/avocado.jpg" width="1" height="400"> Avocados are a great source of healthy fats, vitamins (like vitamin E and vitamin K), and minerals (such as potassium and magnesium). Add sliced avocado to salads, sandwiches, or blend them into smoothies for a creamy texture and extra nutrients. </li> <br> <li> <strong>Greek Yogurt with Fruit and Nuts</strong>: <img src="bmi calculator/img/yogurt.jpg" height="400">  Greek yogurt is high in protein and calcium. Pair it with fresh fruits like berries or bananas for added vitamins and fiber. Sprinkle some nuts (like almonds, walnuts, or pistachios) on top for extra healthy fats and crunch. </li> <br><br><br> These foods not only provide essential nutrients but also offer a good balance of macronutrients to support weight gain in a healthy way. It\'s also important to focus on eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day to increase overall calorie intake.';

    return 'Your weight falls within a healthy range. Keep up the good work with your healthy habits! <br><br><br> <strong>Here are 4 recommendations for people with a normal BMI who want to maintain a healthy lifestyle</strong>: <br><br><br> <li><strong>Prioritize a Balanced Diet</strong>: Even with a normal BMI, focusing on a balanced diet rich in various nutrients is crucial. This means incorporating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats into your meals. This ensures your body gets the vitamins, minerals, and essential building blocks it needs to function optimally.</li> <li><strong>Move Your Body Regularly</strong>: While weight loss might not be the primary goal, regular physical activity offers numerous benefits. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week as recommended by the WHO. This could be brisk walking, cycling, swimming, dancing, or any activity you enjoy that gets your heart rate up.</li> <br><br> <li><strong>Strength Training for Overall Fitness</strong>: Include strength training exercises 2-3 times a week. This doesn\'t have to involve heavy weights at the gym. Bodyweight exercises, resistance bands, or light weights can help build muscle mass, improve bone density, and boost your metabolism, even if your weight stays the same.</li> <br><br> <li><strong>Listen to Your Body\'s Needs</strong>: Pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues. Eat intuitively, stopping when you\'re comfortably satisfied and avoiding restrictive diets. Make sure you\'re getting enough quality sleep (7-8 hours for adults) as sleep deprivation can disrupt hormones that regulate hunger and satiety.</li>';

    return 'It might be beneficial to focus on incorporating more physical activity and balanced nutrition into your routine to maintain a healthier weight. <br><br><br> One effective recommendation for someone who is overweight and looking to manage their weight is to focus on mindful eating. Mindful eating involves paying attention to your food choices, eating habits, and body signals. Here\'s how you can incorporate mindful eating into your routine: <li><strong>Eat Mindfully:</strong> Avoid distractions like watching TV or using your phone while eating. Focus on the flavors, textures, and sensations of each bite. Chew slowly and savor your food.</li> <br><br> <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues. Eat when you\'re physically hungry and stop when you\'re comfortably satisfied, rather than eating until you\'re overly full.</li> <br><br> <li><strong>Choose Nutrient-Dense Foods:</strong> Opt for whole, unprocessed foods that are rich in nutrients and lower in calories. Include plenty of vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats in your meals.</li> <br><br> <li><strong>Practice Portion Control:</strong> Be mindful of portion sizes and avoid oversized servings. Use smaller plates and bowls to help control portion sizes visually.</li>  <br><br><br> For someone who is overweight and aiming to manage their weight effectively, it\'s important to focus on nutritious foods that are lower in calories but still satisfying and fulfilling. Here are three food recommendations: <br><br> <li><strong>Vegetable-Based Meals</strong>: <img src="bmi calculator/img/vegie.jpg" height="400"> Incorporate more vegetables into your meals, as they are low in calories but high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Opt for colorful vegetables like spinach, kale, broccoli, bell peppers, carrots, and tomatoes. You can enjoy them in salads, stir-fries, soups, or roasted as a side dish.</li> <br> <li><strong>Lean Protein Sources</strong>: <img src="bmi calculator/img/proteins.jpg" height="400"> Choose lean protein sources such as skinless poultry (chicken or turkey), fish (salmon, trout, tuna), legumes (beans, lentils), tofu, or low-fat dairy products (Greek yogurt, cottage cheese). Protein-rich foods help promote satiety and muscle maintenance while being lower in calories compared to high-fat meats.</li> <br> <li><strong>Whole Grains</strong>: <img src="bmi calculator/img/grain.jpg" height="400"> Include whole grains in your diet instead of refined grains. Whole grains like quinoa, brown rice, whole wheat bread, oats, and barley provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals, keeping you full for longer and helping to regulate blood sugar levels. Swap refined grains like white rice and white bread for whole grain options in your meals.</li> <br><br><br> Additionally, practicing portion control, staying hydrated with water, and being mindful of snacking habits can also contribute to managing weight effectively. It\'s essential to focus on creating a balanced and sustainable eating pattern that supports overall health and well-being.';
